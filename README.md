A small deep learning library written in [Futhark]{https://futhark-lang.org}
as part of my bachelor thesis.

The library currently supports multilayer perceptron and convolutional networks

A formal documentation is WIP, but see [programs]{https://github.com/HnimNart/futhark_ann_func/tree/master/programs}
for examples on how to build a network using the library

If you find bugs, or find something that can be improved
please open an issue! thanks!
